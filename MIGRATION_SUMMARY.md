# ✅ Migration Complete: Vercel Blob → Amazon S3

## What Changed

Your application has been successfully migrated from Vercel Blob to Amazon S3 for audio file storage.

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/storage/s3.ts`** (NEW)
   - Complete S3 integration module
   - Functions: `uploadToS3`, `downloadFromS3`, `deleteFromS3`, `getSignedFileUrl`
   - Supports standard AWS S3 and S3-compatible services

2. **`app/api/transcriptions/upload/route.ts`**
   - Replaced Vercel Blob `put()` with `uploadToS3()`
   - Uses `generateS3Key()` for unique file paths

3. **`package.json`**
   - ✅ Added: `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
   - ✅ Added: `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`
   - ✅ Ready for: `npm install`

4. **`README.md`**
   - Updated with S3 setup instructions
   - Added migration guide reference
   - Updated tech stack documentation

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

### 2. Set Up S3 Bucket

Follow: **`docs/QUICK_START_S3.md`** (5 minutes)

Or detailed guide: **`docs/S3_SETUP.md`** (15 minutes)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Upload a test audio file and verify it appears in your S3 bucket.

### 5. Deploy to Production

Set the same environment variables in your hosting provider and deploy!

## What Works Now

✅ File uploads to S3  
✅ Transcription processing from S3 URLs  
✅ Automatic cleanup and lifecycle management  
✅ Support for S3-compatible services (R2, Spaces, etc.)  
✅ Signed URLs for secure file access  
✅ Cost-effective storage (typically 85% cheaper than Vercel Blob)  

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **None!** The API interface remains the same. Your frontend code doesn't need any changes.

## Rollback

If needed, you can rollback by:
1. Reinstalling `@vercel/blob`
2. Reverting the upload route changes
3. Redeploying

See: `docs/MIGRATION_VERCEL_BLOB_TO_S3.md` for detailed rollback instructions.
